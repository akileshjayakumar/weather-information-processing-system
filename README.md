# Weather Information Processing System

## Description
This program is a Weather Information Processing System. It allows users to read and process a configuration file containing information about city maps, cloud coverage, and atmospheric pressure. Users can then view various visual representations of this data and generate a summary report.

## Files
- `csci251_a1.cpp`: Main program file containing the implementation of the Weather Information Processing System.
- `akileshMyFunctionsA1.cpp`: Additional functions file containing various functions used in the main program.
- `akileshMyFunctionsA1.h`: Header file for the additional functions file.

## Features
- **Configuration File Processing:** Read and process a configuration file containing city maps, cloud coverage, and atmospheric pressure data.
- **Visual Representation:** Display visual representations of city maps, cloud coverage maps, and atmospheric pressure maps.
- **Summary Report Generation:** Generate a summary report with average cloud cover, atmospheric pressure, and probability of rain for each city.

## Setup
1. **Compilation:** Compile the main program file `csci251_a1.cpp` along with the additional functions file `akileshMyFunctionsA1.cpp` using a C++ compiler.
