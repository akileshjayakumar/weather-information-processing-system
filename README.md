# Weather Information Processing System

## Overview
This program is a Weather Information Processing System. It allows users to read and process a configuration file containing information about city maps, cloud coverage, and atmospheric pressure. Users can then view various visual representations of this data and generate a summary report.

## Key Features
- **Configuration File Processing:** Read and process a configuration file containing city maps, cloud coverage, and atmospheric pressure data.
- **Visual Representation:** Display visual representations of city maps, cloud coverage maps, and atmospheric pressure maps.
- **Summary Report Generation:** Generate a summary report with average cloud cover, atmospheric pressure, and probability of rain for each city.

- ## Files
- `csci251_a1.cpp`: Main program file containing the implementation of the Weather Information Processing System.
- `akileshMyFunctionsA1.cpp`: Additional functions file containing various functions used in the main program.
- `akileshMyFunctionsA1.h`: Header file for the additional functions file.

## Project Setup
1. **Compilation:** Compile the main program file `csci251_a1.cpp` along with the additional functions file `akileshMyFunctionsA1.cpp` using a C++ compiler.
   ```bash
   g++ csci251_a1.cpp akileshMyFunctionsA1.cpp -o weather_processor
   ```
2. **Execution:** Execute the compiled executable to run the Weather Information Processing System.
   ```bash
   ./weather_processor
   ```

To get started with this program, clone or download the repository to your local machine. Compile the program as per the setup instructions above and execute the compiled executable to run the Weather Information Processing System.
